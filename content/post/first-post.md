✌️ Hey there! ✌️

I'm excited you found your way to this little corner of the internet 😁.

My name is ```Laura Wang Qiu```, and I'm currently a student at the Complutense University of Madrid, studying a Videogame Development degree. I'm passionate about technology, design, and programming, and I'm always looking for new ways to learn and grow.

I created this blog to share my journey, experiences, and knowledge with you. I hope you find something useful here, and if you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to reach out to me.

I'm looking forward to connecting with you! 🚀
