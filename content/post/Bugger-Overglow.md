# Introduction to Buffer Overflow in C

I'm actually learning `C` language and I want to focus my learning on the exploitation of binaries in C.

In the next posts, I will be trying to explain to you and also to myself the most basic terms and functions in this field.

ðŸ‘‰ Main Source: [Linux Exploiting - David Puente Castro](https://0xword.com/es/libros/55-linux-exploiting.html)

ðŸš§ First of all, we must take into account...

- The architecture: `x86 (IA32, x86, x86_32, i386)` or `x64 (AMD64, Intel 64, x86_64)`.

- Storage format: `little endian` or `big endian`

- The operating system.

**All subsequent examples are done in `GNU/Linux x86`.**

In my case, I'm using [Ubuntu Desktop](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop) from Windows to perform the tests with an `Intel x64 architecture` and `little endian` format.

The best options are to use a [virtual machine](https://www.virtualbox.org/) (I recommend Oracle VM VirtualBox) or a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to virtualize the work space.

## What is a Buffer Overflow?

A buffer overflow is a computer security vulnerability that occurs when a program or process tries to store more data in a buffer (a temporary data storage area) than it can hold. As a result, the extra data can overwrite adjacent memory areas, causing unexpected behaviors in the program, such as crashes, freezes, or even the execution of malicious code.

Buffer overflows are a common cause of security vulnerabilities, especially in programs written in languages like C and C++, which **DO NOT perform automatic boundary checks on arrays**. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to overwrite the buffer's content with malicious data, such as executable code, leading to arbitrary code execution and compromising the system's security.

Let's take a look into this example from the book:

```c
 1 | #include <string.h>
 2 | #include <stdio.h>
 3 | #include <stdlib.h>
 4 | void func(char *arg)
 5 | {
 6 | 	char name[32];
 7 | 	strcpy(name, arg);
 8 | 	printf("\nWelcome to Linux Exploiting %s\n\n", name);
 9 | }
 10| int main(int argc, char *argv[])
 11| {
 12| 	if (argc != 2) {
 13| 		printf("Usage: %s NAME\n", argv[0]);
 14| 		exit(0);
 15| 	}
 16| 	func(argv[1]);
 17| 	printf("End of program\n\n");
 18| 	return 0;
 19| }
```

In `func() - line 4 to 9`, we are allocating `arg`'s information into `name` with `strcpy(name, arg)` and printing _"Welcome to Linux Exploiting [name]"_ into the standard output. The problem here is that `arg` can be any string of characters entered by the user as we can see in `func(argv[1]) - line 16`.

So, taking into consideration that C doesn't perform automatic boundary checks on arrays, we could overwrite buffer's content like the return of the function.

Let's compile:
```bash
$ gcc -m32 -no-pie -fno-stack-protector -o main main.c
# As I'm using x64, I need to install multilib to compile in x86 (-m32). ALSO, we need to prevent the binary from being placed in any base position (-no-pie) and disable the use of canaries (-fno-stack-protector).
```

If we execute the program...
```bash
$ ./main Laura

Welcome to Linux Exploiting Laura

End of program

```
everything works perfectly BUT, what if we tried with another string:

```bash
$ ./main Lauraaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

Welcome to Linux Exploiting Lauraaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

Segmentation fault # unexpected behavior
```

`Segmentation fault` is the term when a program tries to access a memory location that itâ€™s not allowed to access. Itâ€™s a mechanism provided by the operating system to prevent data corruption and unauthorized access to other programsâ€™ memory spaces.

So, what now?

Let's disassemble the executable and then find the lines that contain the text string `func`.

```bash
$ objdump -d ./main | grep func
080491a6 <func>:
 8049235:       e8 6c ff ff ff          call   80491a6 <func>
```

We can see the beggining of the function `func` in the memory address `080491a6`. What would happen if we exactly overwrote that memory address?

```bash
$ ./main `perl -e 'print "A"x44 . "\xa6\x91\x04\x08"x4'`
# We pass to the program a string of characters generated by Pearl as an argument.

Segmentation fault
```

In short, we have managed to have an unexpected behavior.
